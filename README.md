# 🎾 Tennis Tournament Manager  

## 🏆 Simplify Tournament Administration and Create Archive  

### 🤔 The Problem  

For 17 years, my friend has been running an annual tennis tournament. Managing the tournament is **time-consuming** for him as the tournament follows a unique and complex format:  

1. **🎲 Opening Round**  
   - A **random draw** (‘out of the hat’) decides the four opening matches.  
   - Winners move to the **Main Draw** Semi-Finals.  
   - Losers move to the **Plate Draw** Semi-Finals.  

2. **🏅 Plate Draw**  
   - Consists of two Semi-Finals, a Third-Place Playoff, and a **Plate Final**.  

3. **🏆 Main Draw**  
   - Mirrors the Plate Draw with two Semi-Finals, a Third-Place Playoff, and the **Main Final**.

In addition, much of the tournament’s history has gone from memory. Noone can now remember who played in the 2012 semi-finals. The details are gone!  

### 🖥️ The Website

With this website, we can:  
- **Automate administrative tasks**, reducing manual work for my friend during the tournament.  
- **Preserve match results** for future reference. I am confident all the tournament’s players will in the distant future greatly enjoy looking through the archives at matches they’ve played.

### 🛠️ What It Does  

This website handles the **heavy lifting** so my friend can focus on the tennis:  

- **🎲 Set Initial Draw**: My friend completes a form to select players for the four opening round matches after the initial draw.  
- **🎮 Input Match Results**: My friend uses a live scoring page through which he eventually inputs the winner and score for each match.  
- **📅 Generates Draws**: After the opening round, the website automatically creates the matchups for the Plate and Main Draw later rounds.  
- **🏅 Tracks Champions**: The website dynamically updates a virtual **Honours Board** with each year’s Plate and Main Draw Champions.  
- **📅 Head-To-Head**: Players can look back at all historical results and rivalries via the site’s Head-To-Head page.

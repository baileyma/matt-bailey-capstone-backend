# 🎾 Tennis Tournament Manager  

## 🏆 Simplify Tournament Administration and Create Archive  

### 🤔 The Problem  

For 17 years, my friend has been running an annual tennis tournament. Managing the tournament is **time-consuming** for him, and much of the tournament’s history has gone from memory. Noone can now remember who played in the 2012 semi-finals? The details are gone!  

With **this website**, we can:  
- **Automate administrative tasks**, reducing manual work for my friend during the tournament.  
- **Preserve match results** for future reference. I am confident all the tournament’s players will in the distant future greatly enjoy looking through the archives at matches they’ve played.

The main benefit of this website is its automatic generation of the tournament’s unique and complex format. The format is as follows:  

1. **🎲 Opening Round**  
   - A **random draw** (‘out of the hat’) decides the four opening matches.  
   - Winners move to the **Main Draw** Semi-Finals.  
   - Losers move to the **Plate Draw** Semi-Finals.  

2. **🏅 Plate Draw**  
   - Consists of two Semi-Finals, a Third-Place Playoff, and a **Plate Final**.  

3. **🏆 Main Draw**  
   - Mirrors the Plate Draw with two Semi-Finals, a Third-Place Playoff, and the **Main Final**.

### 🛠️ What This Website Does  

This website handles the **heavy lifting** so my friend can focus on the tennis:  

- **🎲 Set Initial Draw**: My friend completes a form to select players for the four opening round matches after the initial draw.  
- **🎮 Input Match Results**: My friend uses a live scoring page through which he eventually inputs the winner and score for each match.  
- **📅 Generates Draws**: After the opening round, the website automatically creates the matchups for the Plate and Main Draw later rounds.  
- **🏅 Tracks Champions**: The website dynamically updates a virtual **Honours Board** with each year’s Plate and Main Draw Champions.  
- **📅 Head-To-Head**: Players can look back at all historical results and rivalries via the site’s Head-To-Head page.
